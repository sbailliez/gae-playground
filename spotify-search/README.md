spotify-search
==============

An example of using the Spotify API running on Google App Engine Python.

Code was originally written to toy around maybe around 2007.
It was quickly upgraded to support Python 2.7 and Jinja2 which seems to now be the recommended default.

The url for the app is available at http://spotify-search.appspot.com
